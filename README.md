# BabGPUParticlePatch
This is a patch for MV3D / MZ3D that fixes a bug in Babylons GPU Particle System where there was a "dead" pixel in the middle of the canvas when rendering these particles. Just place this under MV3D / MZ3D and you'll be able to make your custom particle systems using the GPU renederer without the dead spot.
